# aerolibb
Originally formulated in 2016, this aerospace package has been recently resurrected. Its purpose is to be a tool for mission planning. 

Notes:
- Spacecrafts are defined as classes and each subsystem (propulsion, power, comms, ADCS, etc.) are classes which can generate objects within the main spacecraft class.
- Aside from system classes, files with functions for simple orbital mechanics, controls, etc. will also be provided for use independently or with a spacecraft.
